  ## Installation
  To be able to run this application, the user will need to run `npm install` in order to install any dependencies that are in the package.json file. In this case the `inquirer`and ‘jest’ packages need to be installed. Inquirer prompts the user from the command-line a series of questions and takes user input data. ‘Jest’ is necessary to run tests on the code. Then to run the application, use `node app.js`.

  ## Usage
  Once the user installs all dependencies and runs the application with `node app.js`, they will answer some questions about their employees (manager, intern or engineer) and then based on their answers, the HTML file with info about the team members will be generated.

  ## Credits
  I was able to get a pretty good start due to reading the `inquirer` package documentation that was available at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#installation. I also would like to give credit to my tutor Andrew Knowles https://github.com/jaknowles97.
